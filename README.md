# Student Project Pairing Problem

The **Student Project Pairing Problem** involves assigning students to projects in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction, respects skill requirements, adheres to project capacities, and satisfies specific constraints. It is a combinatorial optimization problem commonly encountered in educational settings or team-based project environments.

## Problem Description

### Objective
The goal is to assign students to projects such that:
- The total preference score across all student-project assignments is maximized.
- All constraints (e.g., capacity, skill requirements, availability) are satisfied.

---

### Input Data

#### **Students**
A set of students, each characterized by:
- **Skills**: The abilities or knowledge areas a student possesses (e.g., Python, UX Design).
- **Preferences**: A ranked or scored list of preferred projects (higher scores indicate higher preference).
- **Constraints**: Special conditions, such as:
  - Availability: A student can only work on specific projects.
  - Group preference: A student prefers individual or group projects.
  - Pairing: A student must (or must not) work with specific peers.

#### **Projects**
A set of projects, each characterized by:
- **Skill Requirements**: A list of required skills that must be covered by the assigned students.
- **Capacity**: Minimum and maximum number of students allowed to work on the project.
- **Priority**: Some projects may have higher priority and need special consideration.

#### **Preferences**
Each student-project pair has a **preference score**, representing how much a student would like to work on a particular project. These scores are used to guide the optimization process.

---

### Constraints

1. **Assignment Constraint**:
   - Each student can be assigned to at most one project.

2. **Capacity Constraints**:
   - Each project must have a number of assigned students between its minimum and maximum capacity.

3. **Skill Matching**:
   - The assigned students must collectively cover all the required skills for each project.

4. **Student-Specific Constraints**:
   - **Individual Projects**: Some students prefer working alone.
   - **Pairing**: Certain students must (or must not) work together.
   - **Availability**: Students may only be available for specific projects.

5. **Project-Specific Constraints**:
   - Some projects may require diverse teams, such as a mix of technical and creative skills.

| **Student** | **Assigned Project** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Alice       | P1                   |
| Bob         | P3                   |

## Mathematical Formulation

### Decision Variables
Let $x_{ij}$ be a binary variable:
- $x_{ij} = 1$ if student $i$ is assigned to project $j$.
- $x_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.

### Objective Function
Maximize the total preference score:
\[
\text{Maximize } \sum_{i \in \text{Students}} \sum_{j \in \text{Projects}} P_{ij} \cdot x_{ij}
\]

### Constraints
1. **Assignment**:
\[
\sum_{j \in \text{Projects}} x_{ij} \leq 1 \quad \forall i \in \text{Students}
\]

2. **Capacity**:
\[
\text{min\_cap}_j \leq \sum_{i \in \text{Students}} x_{ij} \leq \text{max\_cap}_j \quad \forall j \in \text{Projects}
\]

3. **Skill Matching**:
\[
\sum_{i \in \text{Students}} S_{ik} \cdot x_{ij} \geq R_{jk} \quad \forall j \in \text{Projects}, \forall k \in \text{Skills}
\]

4. **Individual Preference**:
\[
x_{ij} = 0 \quad \forall i \in \text{Students (preferring individual)}, \forall j \in \text{Group Projects}
\]

5. **Pairing Constraints**:
\[
x_{i_1j} = x_{i_2j} \quad \forall j \in \text{Projects}, \text{ if } i_1 \text{ and } i_2 \text{ must work together.}
\]
